# unicornETLproject
  End to end data project following ETL process (extract, transform, load). Scraped data from webpages using BeautifulSoup4 Python library, converted it into a CSV file to prepare for data analysis, and stored it into a local database using SQLite to query using SQL. Used Tableau to visualize and analyze the queried data and insights.
